#Originally written for 100 days of code challenge
#A program that takes 2 user's name and checks their compatibility based on the scores gotten.
#The code checks for how many times the letters in "true" occurs in the names and sets it to a variable
#Also checks for how many times the letters in the word "love" occurs in the name and sets it to another variable. 
#It combines the two variables (love_score) and prints out a message based on the love_score.
